This repo is my **one project a day** portfolio. I’m splitting the work into two main tracks so it’s easy to browse and I can keep my progress consistent.

## Branches (how I’m organizing this)

- **`ml-track`**: classic ML from basics to advanced.
- **`ai-llm-track`**: prompt engineering + agent execution patterns (sequential, parallel, tools, memory).

I’ll keep `main` as the index and put each daily project inside its track folder.

## AI/LLM track (first project)

- **Day 01:** Prompting styles + sequential/parallel execution
  - Folder: `ai-llm-track/day01_agent_prompting`
  - Tech: Python + OpenAI + notebook
- **Day 02:** Prompt chaining (planner → executor → critic)
  - Folder: `ai-llm-track/day02_prompt_chaining`
  - Tech: Python + OpenAI + notebook
- **Day 03:** Tool routing (structured outputs)
  - Folder: `ai-llm-track/day03_tool_routing`
  - Tech: Python + OpenAI + notebook
- **Day 04:** Memory + state (lightweight)
  - Folder: `ai-llm-track/day04_memory_state`
  - Tech: Python + OpenAI + notebook
- **Day 05:** Evaluation + guardrails
  - Folder: `ai-llm-track/day05_evaluation_guardrails`
  - Tech: Python + OpenAI + notebook
- **Day 06:** RAG basics (lightweight)
  - Folder: `ai-llm-track/day06_rag_basics`
  - Tech: Python + OpenAI + notebook

9. Cross-validation + metrics
10. Class imbalance strategies
11. Pipelines (sklearn)
12. Time series basics
13. Clustering + PCA
14. Simple API deployment

**Week 3+: Advanced**

17. Recommender system
18. Intro deep learning
19. CNNs
20. Transfer learning
21+. Real-world case studies

## Notes (written by me)

- I’m aiming for progress over perfection.
- Each folder should have a clear README, runnable code, and a short demo output.

## Subtasks

- [ ] Visit all completed tutorials across both tracks and add theory guides in Markdown for each day.
