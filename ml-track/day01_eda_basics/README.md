# Day 01 — Data cleaning + quick EDA

Today is a simple **data cleaning + EDA** notebook. I wanted something fast that still shows good habits: loading data, checking missing values, and making a couple of charts.

## What this project shows

- Basic data loading and inspection
- Missing value checks + simple cleanup
- A couple of quick plots to understand the data

## Folder layout

```
.
├── notebook.ipynb
```

## How I run it

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Open the notebook and run the cells.

## Notes (written by me)

- I kept this small so I can move fast each day.
- I’ll reuse this EDA template on future datasets.
