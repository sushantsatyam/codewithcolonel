# Day 02 — Baseline model (logistic regression)

Today I’m adding a **baseline model**. I keep it simple: quick train/test split, logistic regression, and a few metrics.

## What this project shows

- Train/test split
- Logistic regression baseline
- Accuracy + confusion matrix

## Folder layout

```

├── notebook.ipynb
```

## How I run it

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```
2. Open the notebook and run the cells.

## Notes (written by me)

- This is intentionally basic so I can compare future models to the baseline.
- I’ll swap in real datasets later.
